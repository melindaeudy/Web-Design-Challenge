# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

My site can be located at:  https://melindaeudy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](https://melindaeudy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. 
  There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, 
		and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](https://melindaeudy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/Visualizations/Comparisons.html), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * Scatter Plots include:
	Latitude vs. Wind Speed
	Latitude vs. Max Temperature
	Latitude vs. Cloudiness
	Latitude vs. Humidity

	All charts were gathered from previous API’s Project.  This project 
	required the use of Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook.
	If interested in this project, follow this link:

* A ["Comparisons" page](https://melindaeudy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/Visualizations/Comparisons.html) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](https://melindaeudy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/Visualizations/Date.html) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component. 
    * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 
	 **	Used Excel macros to enter the <td> and <tr> into each column in .csv
			In a matter of minutes, I was able to copy the table (now HTML) and
			Paste into index.html (all work in Resources folder)


*	Additional Requirements: Bootstrap - grid, navbar, table component, and 
responsiveness CSS media query for navigation menu
